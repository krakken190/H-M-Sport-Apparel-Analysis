𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:
I recently conducted an analysis of product sales data to gain insights into pricing strategies and sales patterns. In this analysis, I explored the relationship between product prices and sales, identified key findings, and developed recommendations based on the results. I am excited to share the findings with you.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬:
1.𝙿𝚛𝚒𝚌𝚎 𝙳𝚒𝚜𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚋𝚞𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗: The majority of products have lower prices, with a mean price of $43.93 and a standard deviation of $29.23. This suggests that there is a wide range of price points available for customers.
2.𝚂𝚊𝚕𝚎𝚜 𝙿𝚊𝚝𝚝𝚎𝚛𝚗𝚜: There is an inverse relationship between product prices and sales. Products with lower prices tend to have higher sales, while products with higher prices tend to have lower sales. This trend is visually depicted in the scatter plot, where the majority of products cluster towards the lower price range.

𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲:
To conduct this analysis, I utilized a dataset containing information on product names, categories, prices, brand names, total samples, product links, and swatch colors. I performed descriptive analysis, including calculating basic statistics, visualizing the distribution and variability of prices, and examining the relationship between prices and sales using scatter plots.

𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐭𝐨 𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:
These findings have important implications for pricing strategies and product recommendations. To optimize sales, it is crucial to carefully consider the pricing strategy based on the observed inverse relationship between price and sales. Additionally, identifying products with high sales at lower price points can help inform marketing strategies and product promotions.
